# Flutter: Identity Verification

This project is a Flutter application that demonstrates routing to various
screens using `go_router` as the underlying navigation mechanism. Some routes are
"protected" and require verifying the device user's identity before being routed
to the screen. The device user is prompted to verify their identity using a
configured identity verification mechanism.
